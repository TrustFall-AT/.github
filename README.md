# TrustFall: A device to protect the hips in the event of a fall

An Assistive Technology (AT) project with Sumanth Sura, Shuling Lin, Venkatraman Varatharajan and Emily Wang.

The assistive technology project at the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science is aimed at solving a problem of a specific client in the Massachusetts community to improve their life. In this course students work in groups of typically 3-4 students to create an assistive piece of technology that serves a need in the community. I worked with Venkatraman Varatharajan, Shuling Lin, and Emily Wang to create a device called TrustFall, which aids fall risk patients by detecting when they are falling and inflating an airbag to cushion them. 
## Problem

Food pantries often have trouble maintaining their inventories and organizing their food supply to deliver items to clients effectively. Furthermore, with a growing demand in food banks, there is a pressing need for software that can connect food pantries and clients.

## Target Audience

The target audience of the proposed application are food bank volunteers, food bank management, and potential clients and donors.

## Solution

We built a cross-platform cloud-based application that improves the organization of food pantries and communication between clients and food banks.

## MVP

* The device detects a fall with an accuracy of at least 90%.
* The device reduces the impact of a fall by at least 60%.
* The device detects a fall prior to the client's impact with the ground.
* The device detects a fall at least half a second before the fall.
* The device inflates to its full size in under one second.
* The device deploys without causing physical injury.
* The chemical(s)/gas used to deploy the airbag is not dangerous to the user.
* The device is easy for the user to lift.
* The device is easy for the user to put on.
* The user can move unhindered when wearing the device.
